# Jeongbogi-Prep-in-Container (Engineer Information Security Prep in Container)

**Jeongbogi** is a **syllabic acronym** commonly used in Korean, short for **정보보안기사** (*Engineer: Information Security*) — a national certification exam covering Linux, cybersecurity, and systems administration.

This project sets up a **lightweight Ubuntu container lab** for practicing Linux fundamentals and security-related command-line skills — all tailored for the **정보보안기사** certification, without the overhead of full virtual machines.
