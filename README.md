# Jeongbogi Prep in Container 

**Jeongbogi** is a **syllabic acronym** commonly used in Korean, short for **ì •ë³´ë³´ì•ˆê¸°ì‚¬** (*Engineer: Information Security*) â€” a national certification exam covering Linux, cybersecurity, and systems administration.

This project sets up a **lightweight Ubuntu container lab** for practicing Linux fundamentals and security-related command-line skills â€” all tailored for the **ì •ë³´ë³´ì•ˆê¸°ì‚¬** certification, without the overhead of full virtual machines.
